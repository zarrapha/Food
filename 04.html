    Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets.
    The Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù,
    béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

 <br>

<ol>
    <li>Cook ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbled; drain excess grease.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Stir in water and black olives; season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in marinara sauce and remove from the heat. 
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Spoon a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. 
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, then sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce and repeat layering, ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese for later.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, but check after 30 minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. 
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
        Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle reserved cheese over the top and return to the oven until melted, about 10 minutes.
    </li>
</ol>
