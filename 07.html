    Tonkatsu is a Japanese dish that consists of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. It involves coating slices of pork with panko, and then frying them in oil.

 <br> <hr>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<br>

<ul>
  <li>2 pork loin chops, about ½" thick, no bones</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
  <li>¼ cup all purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>⅔ cup panko or bread crumbs</li>
  <li>Tonkatsu Sauce</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

 <br>

<ol>
    <li>Make small cuts all over the pork chops with the tip of a knife. Pound the meat with a meat tenderizer. 
        Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the meat.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Coat the meat with flour, dip in egg, and then cover with bread crumbs.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Heat deep frying oil to 350 F, and deep fry the crumb-covered meat. You can check the temperature by dropping a bread crumb in the oil.
        If it comes up to the oil surface right after it's dropped, it's ready.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Fry until the color turns golden brown and the meat floats in the oil, about 5-8 minutes, turning once or twice.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>Set the meat on a cooling rack for a minute. Cut into 5-6 pieces. Drizzle Tonkatsu Sauce over if you like.
    </li>
</ol>
